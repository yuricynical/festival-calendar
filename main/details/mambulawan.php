            The name "Mambulawan" originates from "Mambulao," the old name of Jose Panganiban, which means "bountiful in gold." This reflects the area's historical significance as a mining town even before the Spanish colonial period.
            The festival underscores the town's mining legacy through various activities, including street dancing, art showcases, and community celebrations​.
